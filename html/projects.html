          Play as a yellow ball and tap the screen when touching the red target.
          Collect keys and buy upgrades for a better score. Play on three Game
          Modes(Normal Mode, Hard Mode and Timer Mode). Get a greater highscore
          and eventually enough points to earn the code snippet of the lock from
          the main menu (Normal Snippet = 90, Hard Snippet = 45, Timer Snippet =
          60). Get all the code snippets to unlock Mania Mode (Not a functional
          game mode currently).
