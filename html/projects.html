              Play as a yellow ball and tap the screen when touching the red
              target. Collect keys and buy upgrades for a better score. Play on
              three Game Modes(Normal Mode, Hard Mode and Timer Mode). Get a
              greater highscore and eventually enough points to earn the code
              snippet of the lock from the main menu (Normal Snippet = 90, Hard
              Snippet = 45, Timer Snippet = 60). Get all the code snippets to
              unlock Mania Mode (Not a functional game mode currently).
