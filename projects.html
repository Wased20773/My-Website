            <h2>Net Link Chat App (Mar 10, 2025)</h2>
            <p>
              NetLink is an instant messaging app that allows users to
              communicate through the internet. Users can create an account, and
              add users to chat with. If you want to chat with someone else you
              can freely do so by searching for someone else, only if they are
              already registered in the database. The app has group chat
              functionality, as well as having a favorite chat. You can learn
              about the framework, tools, and challenges that I faced more
              through the button while making this project. As well as how to
              run it your self.
